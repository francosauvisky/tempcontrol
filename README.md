# Tempcontrol

## About this project

The motivation of this project is to create a general application heater controller that's cheap, simple to construct and precise. The idea to use 1N4148 diodes as temperature sensor is due it's ubiquitousness, low price and easy interface.

This project is still in a very young state, so don't expect any applications yet. As this is being written, it's only composed of a demonstration code for using a 1N4148 as thermometer via UART with oversampling to increase it resolution.

## To do list

(from more important to less important)

1. Circuit schematics
2. Heater driver
3. PID feedback code
4. Buttons/display interface
5. Enclosure ideas
